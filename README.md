# JavaFX-Utility-Classes
A series of classes written to extend JavaFX functionality

### IntegerTextField:
A variation on answers from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7555564/what-is-the-recommended-way-to-make-a-numeric-textfield-in-javafx mixed with an answer from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15159988/javafx-2-2-textfield-maxlength and then altered to fit my desires.  
A TextField that only accepts integer values as input.  
Any text pasted into this text field will be stripped of any non-integer characters so that only the integers remain.  
Input may be optionally restricted to a maximum number of digits and to allow or disallow negative values.

There are plans to include options to limit values to a specific range (e.g. if users only want values with the ranges of int, they could call `setMinValueRestriction(Integer.MIN_VALUE)` and `setMaxValueRestriction(Integer.MAX_VALUE)`. While those methods do currently exist, they currently affect no change. 

### CurrencyTextField:
A TextField that only accepts currency values as input.  
Any text pasted into this text field will be stripped of any non-currency characters so that only the valid characters remain.  
Valid characters include the symbol corresponding to the chosen enum value from CurrencyTextField.CurrencySymbol followed by one or more digits, then a period, then two more digits.

CurrencySymbol values with the appendix `_OR_NONE` are allowed to either have their corresponding symbol at the front of the text value or have no symbol at all. If a CurrencySymbol without that appendix is used, the corresponding symbol must always be at the front of the text value unless there is no text present.  
The CurrencySymbol value `NONE` must not have any currency symbol. The CurrencySymbols `ANY` and `ANY_OR_NONE` can have any symbol that corresponds with any valid CurrencySymbol value.

There are plans to include options to set the maximum number of digits before and after the decimal delimiter (similar to IntegerTextField's `setMaxDigits(int)` method).
